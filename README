Console application in C# using neural network with to predict the ideal font colour (black or white) to display over 
any given background colour (red, green, blue).

This learning algorithm was created with no references to any Machine Learning libraries.The neural network framework
was adapted from The One on youtube - https://youtu.be/L_PByyJ9g-I
A TanH activation function was used with a adjustable learning rate and number of feed forward / back propagation iterations.

The number of hidden layers along with neurons in each layer can be set when constructing the NeuralNetwork class. 
The ideal font colour was chosen for 100 different background colours, with effort to reduce biases across the colour 
spectrum. 

This list of 100 lines was shuffled using the rand() function in excel, and split into 75 lines for training data and 
25 for test data. Red, green and blue values (0-255) were normalized (0-1).
Some large errors exist due to the at times subjective nature of background / font aesthetics.
